# Tim Huitt

> I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through creative programming. I've spent several years building my development skills, initially through self-teaching and now formal education. 

> Along the way, I have acquired extensive leadership experience in various industries, including service, finance, and analytics, where I've excelled at guiding, directing, and training teams and management. As my self taught development knowledge increased, I was able to bring solutions to employers, creating demand for my skills and continuing to drive my desire to dive ever deeper. 

> Due to this drive and its recognition by employers, I have developed several full stack applications using Python for standalone applications and VBA for complex excel data processing and manipulation. This is`` in addition to a countless number of personal projects, both small and large. My career journey has equipped me with the ability to drive improved efficiencies and processes. I'm now eager to leverage my skills to become a valuable asset to any team.
